# 🌌 AI-ESRAD 
 
## AI-Enhanced Super-Resolution for Astronomical Data

## 📌 Overview 
 
Astronomical imaging is fundamentally constrained by low resolution, noise, and observational limitations, making it difficult to detect faint celestial objects such as distant galaxies, stellar clusters, and exoplanetary structures. 

AI-ESRAD proposes an AI-driven super-resolution framework that reconstructs high-resolution (HR) astronomical images from low-resolution (LR) inputs while preserving scientific integrity.
The project introduces a learned GAN-based downsampling pipeline to generate realistic synthetic datasets and applies state-of-the-art super-resolution models to enhance astronomical imagery.

## 🚀 Key Contributions 

✔️ GAN-based learned downsampling for realistic LR image generation
✔️ Synthetic HR–LR paired dataset for astronomy
✔️ Implementation of multiple SR models:

* SRGAN
* ESRGAN
* Stable Diffusion Upscaler
* Transformer-based SR
* Restormer
* ResNet-based SR

✔️ Quantitative evaluation using PSNR and SSIM
✔️ Interactive web-based GUI for image enhancement
✔️ Comparative analysis across architectures

## 🧠 Why Learned Downsampling (GANs)?

Traditional methods like bicubic interpolation apply a fixed mathematical function and fail to model real telescope degradations.

**GAN-based downsampling**:

* Learns realistic blur, noise, and distortions
* Mimics real telescope imaging conditions
* Improves generalization of SR models to real data
* Produces scientifically meaningful synthetic datasets
